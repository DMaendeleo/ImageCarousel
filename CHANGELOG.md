## Version 2.0.0 *(2021-05-17)* 🚀

* 🆕 Previous boring custom layout system removed. And view-binding supported custom layout system added. See `CarouselListener` in the sample app for details. 🎉
* 🆕 The carousel is now supported Infinite ∞ looping 🥳! It's default now. You can disable it by setting `infiniteCarousel` to `false`.
* 🆕 Carousel now supports touch-to-pause auto-play. It is default now. You can disable it by setting `touchToPause` to `false`. 🎊
* 🆕 `carouselGravity` attribute added. So you can set carousel item view gravity `START` if you want.
* 🆕 Carousel padding attributes added. You can use `carouselPadding`, `carouselPaddingStart`, `carouselPaddingTop`, `carouselPaddingEnd`, and `carouselPaddingBottom` to set carousel padding.
* 🆕 The `ImageCarousel` is now a lifecycle component. You can register any lifecycle with `registerLifecycle()` method. It is recommended if you enable `autoPlay`. So that when the application is in the pause state, the carousel will be paused and resumed on the app resume.
* 🆕 You can now use `setData()` to set `CarouselItem` list. And `addData()` to add single or multiple items to the carousel. If you set/add data only once, then you can continue using `addData()` method.
* 🆕 You can now get the carousel items using `getData()` method.
* 🆕 Sample app re-designed. Various use cases and inspiring 💡 examples are added. 😎
* ⚠️ `OnItemClickListener` renamed to `CarouselListener` and two new method (`onCreateViewHolder()` and `onBindViewHolder()`) added for the latest custom view feature. `setOnItemClickListener()` also renamed to `setCarouselListener()`.
* ⚠️ `CarouselListener` (previously `OnItemClickListener`) package changed from `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel` to `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel.listener`.
* ⚠️ `CarouselItem` package changed from `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel` to `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel.model`.
* 🛠️ New parameters `position` and `carouselItem` add to `onScrolled` method in  `CarouselOnScrollListener`.
* 🛠️ The default carousel background changed to transparent. You can always change the background of the carousel using `carouselBackground`. The previous value was `#333333`.
* 🛠️ Left and right navigation default button icon replaced with a rounded chevron icon.
